    <p>
      On a recent journey to the Pennsylvania oil regions, I stopped one evening
      with a fellow-traveler at a village which had just been thrown into a
      turmoil of excitement by the exploits of a horse-thief. As we sat around
      the tavern hearth, after supper, we heard the particulars of the rogue's
      capture and escape fully discussed; then followed many another tale of
      theft and robbery, told amid curling puffs of tobacco-smoke; until, at the
      close of an exciting story, one of the natives turned to my traveling
      acquaintance, and, with a broad laugh, said, &ldquo;Kin ye beat that, stranger?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don't know&mdash;maybe I could if I should try. I never happened
      to fall in with any such tall horse-stealing as you tell of, but I knew a
      man who stole a meeting-house once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stole a meetin'-house! That goes a little beyant anything yit,&rdquo; remarked
      another of the honest villagers. &ldquo;Ye don't mean he stole it and carried it
      away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stole it and carried it away,&rdquo; repeated my traveling companion,
      seriously, crossing his legs, and resting his arm on the hack of his
      chair. &ldquo;And, more than all that, I helped him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How happened that?&mdash;for you don't look much like a thief yourself.&rdquo;
       All eyes were now turned upon my friend, a plain New England farmer, whose
      honest homespun appearance and candid speech commanded respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was his hired man, and I acted under orders. His name was Jedwort&mdash;Old
      Jedwort, the boys called him, although he wasn't above fifty when the
      crooked little circumstance happened which I'll make as straight a story
      of as I can, if the company would like to hear it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sartin, stranger! sartin! about stealin' the meetin'-house!&rdquo; chimed in
      two or three voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      My friend cleared his throat, put his hair behind his ears, and with a
      grave, smooth face, but with a merry twinkle in his shrewd gray eye, began
      as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jedwort I said his name was; and I shall never forget how he looked one
      particular morning. He stood leaning on the front gate&mdash;or rather on
      the post, for the gate itself was such a shackling concern a child
      couldn't have leaned on't without breaking it down. And Jedwort was no
      child. Think of a stoutish, stooping, duck-legged man, with a mountainous
      back, strongly suggestive of a bag of grist under his shirt, and you have
      him. That imaginary grist had been growing heavier and heavier, and he
      more and more bent under it, for the last fifteen years and more, until
      his head and neck just came forward out from between his shoulders like a
      turtle's from its shell. His arms hung, as he walked, almost to the
      ground. Being curved with the elbows outward, he looked for all the world,
      in a front view, like a waddling interrogation-point inclosed in a
      parenthesis. If man was ever a quadruped, as I've heard some folks tell,
      and rose gradually from four legs to two, there must have been a time,
      very early in his history, when he went about like Old Jedwort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The gate had been a very good gate in its day. It had even been a genteel
      gate when Jedwort came into possession of the place by marrying his wife,
      who inherited it from her uncle. That was some twenty years before, and
      everything had been going to rack and ruin ever since.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jedwort himself had been going to rack and ruin, morally speaking. He was
      a middling decent sort of man when I first knew him; and I judge there
      must have been something about him more than common, or he never could
      have got such a wife. But then women do marry, sometimes, unaccountably.
      I've known downright ugly and disagreeable fellows to work around, till by
      and by they would get a pretty girl fascinated by something in them which
      nobody else could see, and then marry her in spite of everything;&mdash;just
      as you may have seen a magnetizer on the stage make his subjects do just
      what he pleased, or a black snake charm a bird. Talk about women marrying
      with their eyes open, under such circumstances! They don't marry with
      their eyes open: they are put to sleep, in one sense, and a'n't more than
      half responsible for what they do, if they are that. Then rises the
      question that has puzzled wiser heads than any of ours here, and will
      puzzle more yet, till society is different from what it is now&mdash;how
      much a refined and sensitive woman is bound to suffer from a coarse and
      disgusting master, legally called her husband, before she is entitled to
      break off a bad bargain she scarce had a hand in making. I've sat here
      to-night and heard about men getting goods under false pretences; you've
      told some astonishing big stories, gentlemen, about rogues stealing horses
      and sleighs; and I'm going to tell you about the man who stole a
      meeting-house; but, when all is said, I guess it will be found that more
      extraordinary thieving than all that often goes on under our own eyes, and
      nobody takes any notice of it. There's such a thing, gentlemen, as getting
      hearts under false pretences. There's such a thing as a man's stealing a
      wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I speak with feeling on this subject, for I had an opportunity of seeing
      what Mrs. Jedwort had to put up with from a man no woman of her stamp
      could do anything but detest. She was the patientest creature you ever
      saw. She was even too patient. If I had been tied to such a cub, I think I
      should have cultivated the beautiful and benignant qualities of a wildcat;
      there would have been one good fight, and one of us would have been
      living, and the other would have been dead, and that would have been the
      end of it. But Mrs. Jedwort bore and bore untold miseries and a large
      number of children. She had had nine of these, and three were under the
      sod and six above it when Jedwort ran off with the meeting-house in the
      way I am going on to tell you. There was Maria, the oldest girl, a perfect
      picture of what her mother had been at nineteen. Then there were the two
      boys, Dave and Dan, fine young fellows, spite of their father. Then came
      Lottie, and Susie, and then Willie, a little four-year-old.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was amazing to see what the mother would do to keep her family looking
      decent with the little means she had. For Jedwort was the tightest screw
      ever you saw. It was avarice that had spoiled him, and came so near
      turning him into a beast. The boys used to say he grew so bent looking in
      the dirt for pennies. That was true of his mind, if not of his body. He
      was a poor man, and a pretty respectable man, when he married his wife;
      but he had no sooner come into possession of a little property than he
      grew crazy for more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are a good many men in the world, that nobody looks upon as
      monomaniacs, who are crazy in just that sort of way. They are all for
      laying up money, depriving themselves of comforts, and their families of
      the advantages of society and education, just to add a few dollars to
      their hoard every year; and so they keep on till they die and leave it to
      their children, who would be much better off if a little more had been
      invested in the cultivation of their minds and manners, and less in stocks
      and bonds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jedwort was just one of that class of men, although perhaps he carried
      the fault I speak of a little to excess. A dollar looked so big to him,
      and he held it so close, that at last he couldn't see much of anything
      else. By degrees he lost all regard for decency and his neighbor's
      opinions. His children went barefoot, even after they got to be great boys
      and girls, because he was too mean to buy them shoes. It was pitiful to
      see a nice, interesting girl, like Maria, go about looking as she did,
      while her father was piling his money into the bank. She wanted to go to
      school and learn music, and be somebody; but he wouldn't keep a hired
      girl, and so she was obliged to stay at home and do housework; and she
      could no more have got a dollar out of him to pay for clothes and tuition
      than you could squeeze sap out of a hoe-handle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The only way his wife could ever get anything new for the family was by
      stealing butter from her own dairy, and selling it behind his back. 'You
      needn't say anything to Mr. Jedwort about this batch of butter,' she would
      hint to the storekeeper; 'but you may hand the money to me, or I will take
      my pay in goods.' In this way a new gown, or a piece of cloth for the
      boys' coats, or something else the family needed, would be smuggled into
      the house, with fear and trembling lest old Jedwort should make a row and
      find where the money came from.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The house inside was kept neat as a pin; but everything around it looked
      terribly shiftless. It was built originally in an ambitious style, and
      painted white. It had four tall front pillars, supporting the portion of
      the roof that came over the porch&mdash;lifting up the eyebrows of the
      house, if I may so express myself, and making it look as if it was going
      to sneeze. Half the blinds were off their hinges, and the rest flapped in
      the wind. The front doorstep had rotted away. The porch had once a good
      floor, but for years Jedwort had been in the habit of going to it whenever
      he wanted a board for the pig-pen, until not a bit of floor was left.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I began to tell about Jedwort leaning on the gate that morning. We
      had all noticed him; and as Dave and I brought in the milk, his mother
      asked, 'What is your father planning now? Half the time he stands there,
      looking up the road; or else he's walking up that way in a brown study.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'He's got his eye on the old meeting-house,' says Dave, setting down his
      pail. 'He has been watching it and walking round it, off and on, for a
      week.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was the first intimation I had of what the old fellow was up to. But
      after breakfast he followed me out of the house, as if he had something on
      his mind to say to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Stark,' says he, at last, 'you've always insisted on't that I wasn't an
      enterprisin' man.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I insist on't still,' says I; for I was in the habit of talking mighty
      plain to him, and joking him pretty hard sometimes. 'If I had this farm,
      I'd show you enterprise. You wouldn't see the hogs in the garden half the
      time, just for want of a good fence to keep 'em out. You wouldn't see the
      very best strip of land lying waste, just for want of a ditch. You
      wouldn't see that stone wall by the road tumbling down year after year,
      till by and by you won't be able to see it for the weeds and thistles.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Yes,' says he, sarcastically, 'ye'd lay-out ten times as much money on
      the place as ye'd ever git back agin, I've no doubt. But I believe in
      economy.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That provoked me a little, and I said, 'Economy! You're one of the kind
      of men that'll skin a flint for sixpence and spoil a jack-knife worth a
      shilling. You waste fodder and grain enough every three years to pay for a
      bigger barn&mdash;to say nothing of the inconvenience.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Wal, Stark,' says he, grinning and scratching his head, 'I've made up my
      mind to have a bigger barn, if I have to steal one.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'That won't be the first thing you've stole, neither,' says I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He flared up at that. 'Stole?' says he. 'What did I ever steal?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Well, for one thing, the rails the freshet last spring drifted off from
      Talcott's land onto yours, and you grabbed: what was that but stealing?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'That was luck. He couldn't swear to his rails. By the way, they'll jest
      come in play now.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'They've come in play already,' says I. 'They've gone on to the old
      fences all over the farm, and I could use a thousand more without making
      much show.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'That's 'cause you're so dumbed extravagant with rails, as you are with
      everything else. A few loads can be spared from the fences here and there,
      as well as not. Harness up the team, boys, and git together enough to make
      about ten rods o' zigzag, two rails high.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Two rails?' says Dave, who had a healthy contempt for the old man's
      narrow, contracted way of doing things. 'What's the good of such a fence
      as that?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'It'll be,' says I, 'like the single bar in music. When our old singing
      master asked his class once what a single bar was, Bill Wilkins spoke up
      and said, &ldquo;It's a bar that horses and cattle jump over, and pigs and sheep
      run under.&rdquo;'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'What do you expect to keep out with two rails?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'The <i>law</i>, boys, the <i>law</i>,' says Jedwort. 'I know what I'm
      about. I'll make a fence the <i>law</i> can't run under nor jump over; and
      I don't care a cuss for the cattle and pigs. You git the rails, and I'll
      rip some boards off'n the pig-pen to make stakes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Boards a'n't good for nothin' for stakes,' says Dave. 'Besides, none
      can't be spared from the pig-pen.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I'll have boards enough in a day or two for forty pig-pens,' says
      Jedwort. 'Bring along the rails and dump 'em out in the road for the
      present, and say nothin' to nobody.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We got the rails, and he made his stakes; and right away after dinner he
      called us out. 'Come, boys,' says he, 'now we'll astonish the natives.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The wagon stood in the road, with the last jag of rails still on it.
      Jedwort piled on his stakes, and threw on the crowbar and axe, while we
      were hitching up the team.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Now, drive on, Stark,' says he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Yes; but where shall I drive to?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'To the old meetin'-house,' says Jedwort, trudging on ahead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The old meeting-house stood on an open common, at the northeast corner of
      his farm. A couple of cross-roads bounded it on two sides; and it was
      bounded on the other two by Jedwort's overgrown stone wall. It was a
      square, old-fashioned building, with a low steeple, that had a belfry, but
      no bell in it, and with a high, square pulpit and high, straight-backed
      pews inside. It was now some time since meetings had been held there; the
      old society that used to meet there having separated, one division of it
      building a fashionable chapel in the North Village, and the other a fine
      new church at the Centre.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, the peculiarity about the old church property was, that nobody had
      any legal title to it. A log meeting-house had been built there when the
      country was first settled and the land was of no account. In the course of
      time that was torn down, and a good frame house put up in its place. As it
      belonged to the whole community, no title, either to the house or land,
      was ever recorded; and it wasn't until after the society dissolved that
      the question came up as to how the property was to be disposed of. While
      the old deacons were carefully thinking it over, Jed-wort was on hand, to
      settle it by putting in his claim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Now, boys,' says he, 'ye see what I'm up to.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Yes,' says I, provoked as I could be at the mean trick, 'and I knew it
      was some such mischief all along. You never show any enterprise, as you
      call it, unless it is to get the start of a neighbor. Then you are wide
      awake; then you are busy as the Devil in a gale of wind.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'But what <i>are</i> you up to, pa?' says Dan, who didn't see the trick
      yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The old man says, 'I'm goin' to fence in the rest part of my farm.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'What rest part?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'This part that never was fenced; the old meetin'-house common.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'But, pa,' says Dave, disgusted as I was, 'you've no claim on that.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Wal, if I ha'n't, I'll make a claim. Give me the crowbar. Now, here's
      the corner, nigh as I can squint'; and he stuck the bar into the ground.
      'Make a fence to here from the wall, both sides.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Sho, pa!' says Dan, looking bewildered; 'ye a'n't goin' to fence in the
      old meetin'-house, be ye?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'That's jest what I'm goin' to do. Go and git some big stuns from the
      wall&mdash;the biggest ye can find, to rest the corners of the fence on.
      String the rails along by the road, Stark, and go for another load. Don't
      stand gawpin' there!'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'<i>Gawpin'?</i>' says I; 'it's enough to make anybody <i>gawp</i>. You
      do beat all the critters I ever had to deal with. Haven't ye disgraced
      your family enough already, without stealing a meeting-house?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'How have I disgraced my family?' says he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I put it to him. 'Look at your children; it's all your wife can do
      to prevent 'em from growing up in rags and dirt and ignorance, because you
      are too close-fisted to clothe 'em decently or send 'em to school. Look at
      your house and yard. To see an Irishman's shanty in such a condition seems
      appropriate enough, but a genteel place, a house with pillars, run down
      and gone to seed like that, is an eyesore to the community. Then look at
      your wife. You never would have had any property to mismanage if it hadn't
      been for her; and see the way you show your gratitude for it. You won't
      let her go into company, nor have company at home; you won't allow a hired
      girl in the house, but she and Maria have to do all the drudgery. You make
      perfect slaves of 'em. I swear, if it wa'n't for your wife, I wouldn't
      work for you an hour longer; but she's the best woman in the world, after
      all you've done to break her spirit, and I hate to leave her.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The old fellow squirmed, and wrenched the crowbar in the ground, then
      snarled back: 'Yes! you're waitin' for me to die; then you mean to step
      into my shoes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I hope you'll have a decenter pair than them you've got on, if I'm to
      step into 'em,' says I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'One thing about it,' says he, 'she won't have ye.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I should think,' says I, 'a woman that would marry you would have 'most
      anybody.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So we had it back and forth, till by and by he left me to throw off the
      rails, and went to show the boys how to build the fence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Look here,' says he; 'jest put a thunderin' big stun to each corner;
      then lay your rail on; then drive your pair of stakes over it like a
      letter X.' He drove a pair. 'Now put on your rider. There's your letter X,
      ridin' one length of rails and carryin' another. That's what I call
      puttin' yer alphabet to a practical use; and I say there a'n't no sense in
      havin' any more education than ye <i>can</i> put to a practical use. I've
      larnin' enough to git along in the world; and if my boys have as much as
      I've got, they'll git along. Now work spry, for there comes Deacon
      Talcott.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Wal, wall' says the Deacon, coming up, puffing with excitement; 'what ye
      doin' to the old meetin'-house?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Wal,' says Jedwort, driving away at his stakes, and never looking up,
      'I've been considerin' some time what I should do with't, and I've
      concluded to make a barn on't.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Make a barn! make a barn!' cries the Deacon. 'Who give ye liberty to
      make a barn of the house of God?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Nobody; I take the liberty. Why shouldn't I do what I please with my own
      prop'ty?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Your own property&mdash;what do you mean? 'Ta'n't your meetin'-house.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Whose is't, if 'ta'n't mine?' says Jedwort, lifting his turtle's head
      from between his horizontal shoulders, and grinning in the Deacon's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'It belongs to the society,' says the Deacon.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'But the s'ciety's pulled up stakes and gone off.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'It belongs to individooals of the society&mdash;to individooals.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Wal, I'm an individooal,' says Jedwort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'You! you never went to meetin' here a dozen times in your life!'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I never did have my share of the old meet-in'-house, that's a fact,'
      says Jedwort; 'but I'll make it up now.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'But what are ye fencin' up the common for?' says the Deacon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'It'll make a good calf-pastur'. I've never had my share o' the vally o'
      that, either. I've let my neighbors' pigs and critters run on't long
      enough; and now I'm jest goin' to take possession o' my own.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Your own!' says the Deacon, in perfect consternation. 'You've no deed
      on't.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Wal, have you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'No&mdash;but&mdash;the society&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'The s'ciety, I tell ye,' says Jedwort, holding his head up longer than I
      ever knew him to hold it up at a time and grinning all the while in
      Tal-cott's face&mdash;'the s'ciety is split to pieces. There a'n't no
      s'ciety now&mdash;any more'n a pig's a pig arter you've butchered and e't
      it. You've e't the pig amongst ye, and left me the pen. The s'ciety never
      had a deed o' this 'ere prop'ty; and no man never had a deed o' this e're
      prop'ty. My wife's gran'daddy, when he took up the land here, was a
      good-natered sort of man, and he allowed a corner on't for his neighbors
      to put up a temp'rary meetin'-house. That was finally used up&mdash;the
      kind o' preachin' they had them days was enough to use up in a little time
      any house that wa'n't fire-proof; and when that was preached to pieces,
      they put up another shelter in its place. This is it. And now't the land
      a'n't used no more for the puppose 'twas lent for, it goes back nat'rally
      to the estate 'twas took from, and the buildin's along with it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'That's all a sheer fabrication,' says the Deacon. 'This land was never a
      part of what's now your farm, any more than it was a part of mine.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Wal,' says Jedwort, 'I look at it in my way, and you've a perfect right
      to look at it in your way. But I'm goin' to make sure o' my way, by
      puttin' a fence round the hull concern.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'And you're usin' some of my rails for to do it with!' says the Deacon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Can you swear they're your rails?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Yes, I can; they're the rails the freshet carried off from my farm last
      spring, and landed on to yourn.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'So I've heard ye say. But can you swear to the partic'lar rails? Can you
      swear, for instance, 't this 'ere is your rail? or this 'ere one?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'No; I can't swear to precisely them two&mdash;but&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Can you swear to these two? or to any one or two?' says Jedwort. 'No, ye
      can't. Ye can swear to the lot in general, but you can't swear to any
      partic'lar rail, and that kind o' swearin' won't stand law, Deacon
      Talcott. I don't boast of bein' an edicated man, but I know suthin' o'
      what law is, and when I know it, I dror a line there, and I toe that line,
      and I make my neighbors toe that line, Deacon Talcott. Nine p'ints o' the
      law is possession, and I'll have possession o' this 'ere house and land by
      fencin' on't in; and though every man't comes along should say these 'ere
      rails belong to them, I'll fence it in with these 'ere very rails.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jedwort said this, wagging his obstinate old head, and grinning with his
      face turned up pugnaciously at the Deacon; then went to work again as if
      he had settled the question, and didn't wish to discuss it any further.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for Talcott, he was too full of wrath and boiling indignation to
      answer such a speech. He knew that Jedwort had managed to get the start of
      him with regard to the rails, by mixing a few of his own with those he had
      stolen, so that nobody could tell 'em apart; and he saw at once that the
      meeting-house was in danger of going the same way, just for want of an
      owner to swear out a clear title to the property. He did just the wisest
      thing when he swallowed his vexation, and hurried off to alarm the leading
      men of the two societies, and to consult a lawyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'He'll stir up the old town like a bumblebee's nest,' says Jedwort.
      'Hurry up, boys, or there'll be a buzzin' round our ears 'fore we git
      through!'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I wish ye wouldn't, pa!' says Dave, 'Why don't we 'tend to our own
      business, and be decent, like other folks? I'm sick of this kind of life.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Quit it, then,' says Jedwort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Do you tell me to quit it?' says Dave, dropping the end of a rail he was
      handling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Yes, I do; and do it dumbed quick, if ye can't show a proper respect to
      your father!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dave turned white as a sheet, and he trembled as he answered back, 'I
      should be glad to show you respect, if you was a man I could feel any
      respect for.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At that Jedwort caught hold of the iron bar that was sticking in the
      ground, where he had been making a hole for a stake, and pulled away at
      it. 'I'll make a stake-hole in you!' says he. 'It's enough to have a sassy
      hired man round, without bein' jawed by one's own children!'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dave was out of reach by the time the bar came out of the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Come here, you villain!' says the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I'd rather be excused,' says Dave, backing off. 'I don't want any
      stake-holes made in me to-day. You told me to quit, and I'm going to, You
      may steal your own meeting-houses in future; I won't help.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was a short race. Dave's young legs proved altogether too smart for
      the old waddler's, and he got off. Then Jedwort, coming back, wheezing and
      sweating, with his iron bar, turned savagely on me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've a good notion to tell you to go too!'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Very well, why don't ye?' says I. 'Im ready.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'There's no livin' with ye, ye're gettin' so dumbed sassy! What I keep ye
      for is a mystery to me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'No, it a'n't; you keep me because you can't get another man to fill my
      place. You put up with my sass for the money I bring ye in.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Hold your yawp,' says he, 'and go and git another load of rails. If ye
      see Dave, tell him to come back to work.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did see Dave, but, instead of telling him to go back, I advised him to
      put out from the old home and get his living somewhere else. His mother
      and Maria agreed with me; and when the old man came home that night Dave
      was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I got back with my second load, I found the neighbors assembling to
      witness the stealing of the old meeting-house, and Jedwort was answering
      their remonstrances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'A meetin'-house is a respectable kind o' prop'ty to have round,' says
      he. 'The steeple'll make a good show behind my house. When folks ride by,
      they'll stop and look, and say, &ldquo;There's a man keeps a private
      meetin'-house of his own.&rdquo; I can have preachin' in't, too, if I want. I'm
      able to hire a preacher of my own, or I can preach myself and save the
      expense.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, neither sarcasm nor argument could have any effect on such a
      man. As the neighbors were going away, Jedwort shouted after 'em: 'Call
      agin. Glad to see ye. There'll be more sport in a few days, when I take
      the dumbed thing away.' (The dumbed thing was the meeting-house.) 'I
      invite ye all to see the show. Free gratis. It'll be good as a circus, and
      a 'tarnal sight cheaper. The women can bring their knittin', and the gals
      their everlastin' tattin'. As it'll be a pious kind o' show, bein' it's a
      meetin'-house, guess I'll have notices gi'n out from the pulpits the
      Sunday afore.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The common was fenced in by sundown; and the next day Jedwort had over a
      house-mover from the North Village to look and see what could be done with
      the building. 'Can ye snake it over, and drop it back of my house?' says
      he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It'll be a hard job,' says old Bob, 'without you tear down the steeple
      fust.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Jedwort said, 'What's a meetin'-house 'thout a steeple? I've got my
      heart kind o' set on that steeple, and I'm bound to go the hull hog on
      this 'ere concern, now I've begun.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I vow,' says Bob, examining the timbers, 'I won't warrant but the old
      thing'll all tumble down.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I'll resk it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Yes; but who'll resk the lives of me and my men?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'O, you'll see if it's re'ly goin' to tumble, and look out. I'll engage
      't me and my boys'll do the most dangerous part of the work. Dumbed if I
      wouldn't agree to ride in the steeple and ring the bell if there was one.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've never heard that the promised notices were read from the pulpits;
      but it wasn't many days before Bob came over again, bringing with him this
      time his screws and ropes and rollers, his men and timbers, horse and
      capstan; and at last the old house might have been seen on its travels.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was an exciting time all around. The societies found that Jedwort's
      fence gave him the first claim to house and land unless a regular siege of
      the law was gone through to beat him off&mdash;and then it might turn out
      that he would beat them. Some said fight him; some said let him be&mdash;the
      thing a'n't worth going to law for; and so, as the leading men couldn't
      agree as to what should be done, nothing was done. That was just what
      Jedwort had expected, and he laughed in his sleeve while Bob and his boys
      screwed up the old meeting-house, and got their beams under it, and set it
      on rollers, and slued it around, and slid it on the timbers laid for it
      across into Jedwort's field, steeple foremost, like a locomotive on a
      track.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a trying time for the women folks at home. Maria had declared
      that, if her father did persist in stealing the meeting-house, she would
      not stay a single day after it, but would follow Dave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That touched me pretty close, for, to tell the truth, it was rather more
      Maria than her mother that kept me at work for the old man. 'If you go,'
      says I, 'then there is no object for me to stay; I shall go too.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'That's what I supposed,' says she; 'for there's no reason in the world
      why you should stay. But then Dan will go; and who'll be left to take
      sides with mother? That's what troubles me. Oh, if she could only go too!
      But she won't; and she couldn't if she would, with the other children
      depending on her. Dear, dear! what shall we do?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The poor girl put her head on my shoulder, and cried; and if I should own
      up to the truth, I suppose I cried a little too. For where's the man that
      can hold a sweet woman's head on his shoulder, while she sobs out her
      trouble, and he hasn't any power to help her&mdash;who, I say, can do any
      less, under such circumstances, than drop a tear or two for company?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Never mind; don't hurry,' says Mrs. Jed-wort. 'Be patient, and wait a
      while, and it'll all turn out right, I'm sure.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Yes, you always say, &ldquo;Be patient, and wait!&rdquo;' says Maria, brushing back
      her hair. 'But, for my part, I'm tired of waiting, and my patience has
      given out long ago. We can't always live in this way, and we may as well
      make a change now as ever. But I can't bear the thought of going and
      leaving you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here the two younger girls came in; and, seeing that crying was the order
      of the day, they began to cry; and when they heard Maria talk of going,
      they declared they would go; and even little Willie, the four-year-old,
      began to howl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'There, there! Maria! Lottie! Susie! said Mrs. Jedwort, in her calm way;
      'Willie, hush up! I don't know what we are to do; but I feel that
      something is going to happen that will show us the right way, and we are
      to wait. Now go and wash the dishes, and set the cheese.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was just after breakfast, the second day of the moving; and sure
      enough, something like what she prophesied did happen before another sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The old frame held together pretty well till along toward night, when the
      steeple showed signs of seceding. 'There she goes! She's falling now!'
      sung out the boys, who had been hanging around all day in hopes of seeing
      the thing tumble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The house was then within a few rods of where Jedwort wanted it; but Bob
      stopped right there, and said it wasn't safe to haul it another inch.
      'That steeple's bound to come down, if we do,' says he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Not by a dumbed sight, it a'n't,' says Jedwort, 'Them cracks a'n't
      nothin'; the j'ints is all firm yit.' He wanted Bob to go up and examine;
      but Bob shook his head&mdash;the concern looked too shaky. Then he told me
      to go up; but I said I hadn't lived quite long enough, and had a little
      rather be smoking my pipe on <i>terra firma</i>. Then the boys began to
      hoot. 'Dumbed if ye a'n't all a set of cowards,' says he. 'I'll go up
      myself.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We waited outside while he climbed up inside. The boys jumped on the
      ground to jar the steeple, and make it fall. One of them blew a horn&mdash;as
      he said, to bring down the old Jericho&mdash;and another thought he'd help
      things along by starting up the horse, and giving the building a little
      wrench. But Bob put a stop to that; and finally out came a head from the
      belfry window; It was Jedwort, who shouted down to us: 'There ain't a
      j'int or brace gi'n out. Start the hoss, and I'll ride. Pass me up that
      'ere horn, and&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just then there came a cracking and loosening of timbers; and we that
      stood nearest had only time to jump out of the way, when down came the
      steeple crashing to the ground, with Jedwort in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope it killed the cuss,&rdquo; said one of the village story-tellers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Worse than that,&rdquo; replied my friend; &ldquo;it just cracked his skull&mdash;not
      enough to put an end to his miserable life, but only to take away what
      little sense he had. We got the doctors to him, and they patched up his
      broken head; and, by George, it made me mad to see the fuss the women
      folks made over him. It would have been my way to let him die; but they
      were as anxious and attentive to him as if he had been the kindest husband
      and most indulgent father that ever lived; for that's women's style:
      they're unreasoning creatures.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Along toward morning, we persuaded Mrs. Jedwort, who had been up all
      night, to lie down a spell and catch a little rest, while Maria and I sat
      up and watched with the old man. All was still except our whispers and his
      heavy breathing; there was a lamp burning in the next room; when all of a
      sudden a light shone into the windows, and about the same time we heard a
      roaring and crackling sound. We looked out, and saw the night all lighted
      up, as if by some great fire. As it appeared to be on the other side of
      the house, we ran to the door, and there what did we see but the old
      meeting-house all in flames! Some fellows had set fire to it to spite
      Jedwort. It must have been burning some time inside; for when we looked
      out the flames had burst through the roof.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As the night was perfectly still, except a light wind blowing away from
      the other buildings on the place, we raised no alarm, but just stood in
      the door and saw it burn. And a glad sight it was to us, you may be sure.
      I just held Maria close to my side, and told her that all was well&mdash;it
      was the best thing that could happen. 'O yes,' says she, 'it seems to me
      as though a kind Providence was burning up his sin and home out of our
      sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had never yet said anything to her about marriage&mdash;for the time to
      come at that had never seemed to arrive; but there's nothing like a little
      excitement to bring things to a focus. You've seen water in a tumbler just
      at the freezing-point, but not exactly able to make up its mind to freeze,
      when a little jar will set the crystals forming, and in a minute what was
      liquid is ice. It was the shock of events that night that touched my life
      into crystals&mdash;not of ice, gentlemen, by any manner of means.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After the fire had got along so far that the meeting-house was a gone
      case, an alarm was given probably by the very fellows that set it, and a
      hundred people were on the spot before the thing had done burning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course these circumstances put an end to the breaking up of the
      family. Dave was sent for, and came home. Then, as soon as we saw that the
      old man's brain was injured so that he wasn't likely to recover his mind,
      the boys and I went to work and put that farm through a course of
      improvement it would have done your eyes good to see. The children were
      sent to school, and Mrs. Jedwort had all the money she wanted now to
      clothe them, and to provide the house with comforts, without stealing her
      own butter. Jedwort was a burden; but, in spite of him, that was just
      about the happiest family, for the next four years, that ever lived on
      this planet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jedwort soon got his bodily health, but I don't think he knew one of us
      again after his hurt. As near as I could get at his state of mind, he
      thought he had been changed into some sort of animal. He seemed inclined
      to take me for a master, and for four years he followed me around like a
      dog. During that time he never spoke, but only whined and growled. When I
      said, 'Lie down,' he'd lie down; and when I whistled he'd come.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I used sometimes to make him work; and certain simple things he would do
      very well, as long as I was by. One day I had a jag of hay to get in; and,
      as the boys were away, I thought I'd have him load it. I pitched it on to
      the wagon about where it ought to lie, and looked to him only to pack it
      down. There turned out to be a bigger load than I had expected, and the
      higher it got, the worse the shape of it, till finally, as I was starting
      it toward the barn, off it rolled, and the old man with it, head foremost.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He struck a stone heap, and for a moment I thought he was killed. But he
      jumped up and spoke for the first time. '<i>I'll blow it</i>,' says he,
      finishing the sentence he had begun four years before, when he called for
      the horn to be passed up to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn't have been much more astonished if one of the horses had
      spoken. But I saw at once that there was an expression in Jedwort's face
      that hadn't been there since his tumble in the belfry; and I knew that, as
      his wits had been knocked out of him by one blow on the head, so another
      blow had knocked 'em in again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Where's Bob?' says he, looking all round.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Bob?' says I, not thinking at first who he meant. Oh, Bob is dead&mdash;he
      has been dead these three years.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without noticing my reply, he exclaimed: 'Where did all that hay come
      from? Where's the old meetin'-house?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Don't you know?' says I. 'Some rogues set fire to it the night after you
      got hurt, and burnt it up.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He seemed then just beginning to realize that something extraordinary had
      happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Stark,' says he, 'what's the matter with ye? You're changed.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Yes,' say I, 'I wear my beard now, and I've grown older!'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Dumbed if 'ta'n't odd!' says he. 'Stark, what in thunder's the matter
      with <i>me?</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'You've had meeting-house on the brain for the past four years,' says I;
      'that's what's the matter.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was some time before I could make him understand that he had been out
      of his head, and that so long a time had been a blank to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he said, 'Is this my farm?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Don't you know it?' says I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'It looks more slicked up than ever it used to,' says he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Yes,' says I; 'and you'll find everything else on the place slicked up
      in about the same way.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Where's Dave?' says he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Dave has gone to town to see about selling the wool.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Where's Dan?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Dan's in college. He takes a great notion to medicine; and we're going
      to make a doctor of him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Whose house is that?' says he, as I was taking him home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'No wonder you don't know it,' says I. 'It has been painted, and
      shingled, and had new blinds put on; the gates and fences are all in prime
      condition; and that's a new barn we put up a couple of years ago.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Where does the money come from, to make all these improvements?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'It comes off the place,' says I. 'We haven't run in debt the first cent
      for anything, but we've made the farm more profitable than it ever was
      before.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'That <i>my</i> house?' he repeated wonderingly, as we approached it.
      'What sound is that?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'That's Lottie practicing her lesson on the piano.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'A pianer in my house?' he muttered. 'I can't stand that!' He listened.
      'It sounds pooty, though!'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Yes, it does sound pretty, and I guess you'll like it How does the place
      suit you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'It <i>looks</i> pooty.' He started. 'What young lady is that?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was Lottie, who had left her music and stood by the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'My dahter! ye don't say! Dumbed if she a'n't a mighty nice gal.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Yes,' says I; 'she takes after her mother.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just then Susie, who heard talking, ran to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Who's that agin?' says Jedwort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Wal, <i>she's</i> a mighty nice-lookin' gal!'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Yes,' says I, she takes after her mother.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Little Willie, now eight years old, came out of the woodshed with a
      bow-and-arrow in his hand, and stared like an owl, hearing his father
      talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'What boy is that?' says Jedwort. And when I told him, he muttered, 'He's
      an ugly-looking brat!'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'He's more like his father,' says I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The truth is, Willie was such a fine boy the old man was afraid to praise
      him, for fear I'd say of him, as I'd said of the girls, that he favored
      his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Susie ran back and gave the alarm; and then out came mother, and Maria
      with her baby in her arms, for I forgot to tell you that we had been
      married now nigh on to two years.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the women folks were as much astonished as I had been when Jedwort
      first spoke, and a good deal more delighted. They drew him into the house;
      and I am bound to say he behaved remarkably well. He kept looking at his
      wife, and his children, and his grandchild, and the new paper on the
      walls, and the new furniture, and now and then asking a question or making
      a remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'It all comes back to me now,' says he at last. 'I thought I was living
      in the moon, with a superior race of human bein's; and this is the place,
      and you are the people.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wasn't more than a couple of days before he began to pry around, and
      find fault, and grumble at the expense; and I saw there was danger of
      things relapsing into something like their former condition. So I took him
      one side, and talked to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Jedwort,' says I, 'you're like a man raised from the grave. You was the
      same as buried to your neighbors, and now they come and look at you as
      they would at a dead man come to life. To you, it's like coming into a new
      world, and I'll leave it to you now, if you don't rather like the change
      from the old state of things to what you see around you to-day. You've
      seen how the family affairs go on&mdash;how pleasant everything is, and
      how we all enjoy ourselves. You hear the piano, and like it; you see your
      children sought after and respected, your wife in finer health and spirits
      than you've ever known her since the day she was married; you see industry
      and neatness everywhere on the premises; and you're a beast if you don't
      like all that. In short, you see that our management is a great deal
      better than yours; and that we beat you even in the matter of economy.
      Now, what I want to know is this: whether you think you'd like to fall
      into our way of living, or return like a hog to your wallow.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I don't say but what I like your way of livin' very well,' he grumbled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Then,' says I, 'you must just let us go ahead, as we have been going
      ahead. Now's the time for you to turn about and be a respectable man, like
      your neighbors. Just own up, and say you've not only been out of your head
      the past four years, but that you've been more or less out of your head
      the last four-and-twenty years. But say you're in your right mind now, and
      prove it by acting like a man in his right mind. Do that, and I'm with
      you; we're all with you. But go back to your old dirty ways, and you go
      alone. Now I sha'n't let you off till you tell me what you mean to do.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He hesitated some time, then said, 'Maybe you're about right, Stark; you
      and Dave and the old woman seem to be doin' pooty well, and I guess I'll
      let you go on.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here my friend paused, as if his story was done; when one of the villagers
      asked, &ldquo;About the land where the old meetin'-house stood&mdash;what ever
      was done with that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was appropriated for a new school-house; and there my little shavers
      go to school.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And old Jedwort, is he alive yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Both Jedwort and his wife have gone to that country where meanness and
      dishonesty have a mighty poor chance&mdash;where the only investments
      worth much are those recorded in the Book of Life. Mrs. Jedwort was rich
      in that kind of stock; and Jedwort's account, I guess, will compare
      favorably with that of some respectable people, such as we all know. I
      tell ye, my friends,&rdquo; continued my fellow-traveler, &ldquo;there's many a man,
      both in the higher and lower ranks of life, that 't would do a deal of
      good, say nothing of the mercy 'twould be to their families, just to knock
      'em on the head, and make Nebu-chadnezzars of 'em&mdash;then, after they'd
      been turned out to grass a few years, let 'em come back again, and see how
      happy folks have been, and how well they have got along without 'em.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I carry on the old place now,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;The younger girls are married
      off; Dan's a doctor in the North Village; and as for Dave, he and I have
      struck ile. I'm going out to look at our property now.&rdquo;
